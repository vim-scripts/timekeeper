Keeps a log of used (wasted) time. The script will trigger every hour whereupon the script will beep and you'll enter a description of what you'll be doing during the next hour.

Keys:
<Leader>E to insert a new hour entry
<Leader>D to insert a new date entry

Commands:
Autojournal on | off for setting off and on the autojournalling feature

The script will uninstall (remove itself from memory) after the current journal is closed.
